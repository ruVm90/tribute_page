                Sandor Clegane is a fictional character from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga. Known for his terrifying appearance, his sullen and gruff attitude and his abilities as a warrior.<br>
                In the HBO television adaptation of Game of Thrones, the character of Sandor Clegane is played by the actor <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McCann" target="_blank">Rory McCann</a>.

                    Sandor Clegane is described as a very tall, powerfully muscled man. He wears his long hair combed to one side, as the left side of his head is disfigured by fire.
                    A characteristic feature is his helmet in the shape of a hound's head, which he wears to intimidate in battle. This helmet is partially damaged by the Valyrian fire at the Blackwater. His face is described as elongated with a hooked nose and left eye narrowed by burns.
                    Apparently he cannot speak without twisting his mouth, due to the burns as well.

                    A victim of the violence of his brother Gregor, who was even bigger, stronger and more violent than him, Sandor developed a particular hatred for the world around him and a contempt for knights, whom he considered hypocrites. More so when his brother Gregor was anointed as such by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, only for Gregor to murder his brother's wife and children. This is why Sandor never wanted to be named and became the first member of the Kingsguard without being an anointed knight.
                    Nor did he ever wear anything that identified him as a Royal Guard other than the white cloak. Sandor kept his suffering to himself, soothing his sorrows with alcohol and taking refuge in violence and blood.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    When he was just a child, Sandor dared to play with one of his brother Gregor's toys. Gregor found out and threw Sandor's face into a brazier, leaving his face scarred for life.
                     His father excused it by saying that Sandor's bed had caught fire. When his brother became head of House Clegane, Sandor fled to Lannisport where he put his sword in the service of House Lannister.
                      He would be appointed sworn sword and bodyguard to Prince Joffrey Baratheon. It was around this time that he earned the nickname "Dog" for his loyalty and fierceness.
